## Docs and Binaries

All documentation about this project, including the latest downloads and installation instructions
can be found on the Comic Vine Scraper [Wiki page](https://github.com/cbanack/comic-vine-scraper/wiki/).

### Technical Details
 
This project is written for Windows, using IronPython and the .NET library.  It displays WinForms graphics and make heavy use of the [ComicVine RESTful API](http://www.comicvine.com/api/).  It is a _plugin_ for the [ComicRack](http://comicrack.cyolito.com/) comic book reader, which is a standalone Windows desktop application. Except during development (see below), Comic Vine Scraper does _not_ run outside of ComicRack's plugin environment.   

This project's repository is configured to compile and run in the [Eclipse IDE](https://eclipse.org/) using the [Aptana Pydev](http://pydev.org/) plugin with IronPython correctly installed and configured.

### Pull Requests

At this point, I am not accepting pull requests.  Comic Vine Scraper is a stable, mature project and most of the work on it these days is maintenance and bug fixing.  I may accept well-written pull requests for straightforward bug fixes, but _please contact me_ before you start doing any work.  I don't want to waste your time.
